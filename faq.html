          Frequently Asked Questions:
        </h2>
        <p class="q">How does it detect if you are clicking a tile or not?</p>
        <p>By using the built in built in mousePressed and mouseButton variables, we can determine if the mouse is being pressed and which button is pressed.
          All we need to do after is to check that the mouse is inside the tile.
        </p>
        <p class="q">How is the Personal High Scores saved?</p>
        <p>The personal high scores are stored on your computer in .txt files called Easy, Medium, Hard, and Insane. When you select a difficulty,
          The program uses the name of the difficulty to determine which file to change. We used the built in loadStrings() function to load everything in
          a file into a String array and use the built in String.compareTo() function to check which time is less. Finally, we used the createWriter() function to write
          the best score into the file.
        </p>
        <p class="q">How does the program randomly generate bombs?</p>
        <p>
          Before clicking anything, no bombs are generated. This is to make sure that when the user first presses a tile, it is not a bomb.
          Once a tile is clicked however, the program will randomly generate an x and y coordinate and as long as those coordinates
          are not the tile clicked or around the tile clicked, the program will set that tile to a bomb. Once all of the bombs are set, the program will go to each tile and search
          around the tile to check how many bombs are around it.
