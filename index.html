      About this Program
    </h1>
    <h2>What does this Program do?</h2>
    <p> <a></a> This program uses <strong><a href="https://processing.org/">processing 3</a></strong> and <strong><a
          href="http://www.micromind.com/processing/brc/BRCWebService.html">BRC</a></strong>, an
      external site that creates browser-based controls for processing 3, to make Minesweeper. Minesweeper is a
      videogame first designed in 1989 and came
      preinstalled with earlier versions of Windows.
    </p>
    <h2>What is Minesweeper</h2>
    <p><a></a>Minesweeper is a puzzle game with the objective of clearing a rectangular board containing hidden "mines"
      or
      bombs without detonating any of them. Each tile that is not a mine will have the number of mines surrounding it,
      and
      you must use those clues to uncover mines and other unmined tiles. You can win the game by openning all the
      unmined tiles.
    </p>
    <h2>Bugs...Ew!</h2>
    <p>
      As of this moment, most gamebreaking bugs have been fixed. If you do find any remaining bugs, please email either

  <a name="#FAQ">
    <h2>
      Frequently Asked Questions:
    </h2>
    <p class="q">How does it detect if you are clicking a tile or not?</p>
    <p>By using the built in built in mousePressed and mouseButton variables, we can determine if the mouse is being pressed and which button is pressed.
      All we need to do after is to check that the mouse is inside the tile.
    </p>
    <p class="q">How is the Personal High Scores saved?</p>
    <p>The personal high scores are stored on your computer in .txt files called Easy, Medium, Hard, and Insane. When you select a difficulty,
      The program uses the name of the difficulty to determine which file to change. We used the built in loadStrings() function to load everything in
      a file into a String array and use the built in String.compareTo() function to check which time is less. Finally, we used the createWriter() function to write
      the best score into the file.
    </p>
    <p class="q">How does the program randomly generate bombs?</p>
    <p>
      Before clicking anything, no bombs are generated. This is to make sure that when the user first presses a tile, it is not a bomb.
      Once a tile is clicked however, the program will randomly generate an x and y coordinate and as long as those coordinates
      are not the tile clicked or around the tile clicked, the program will set that tile to a bomb. Once all of the bombs are set, the program will go to each tile and search
      around the tile to check how many bombs are around it.

    <p>This game was made by <strong>Vincent Wang and Thomas Zhang</strong>. Vincent Wang made the Tile class, the
      reveal() function, and the checkNewRecord() function, while Thomas Zhang made the checkBombs() function, the
      setup() function, and the draw() function.
      Both contributed to the creation of this website.

      Special thanks to ur beta testers: <strong>Kevin Huang and Kelvin Zhao</strong> for finding many gamebreaking bugs
      and making other suggestions to help us bring you this game.
