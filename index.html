      About this Program
    </h1>
    <h2>What does this Program do?</h2>
    <p> <a></a> This program uses <strong><a href="https://processing.org/">processing 3</a></strong> and <strong><a
          href="http://www.micromind.com/processing/brc/BRCWebService.html">BRC</a></strong>, an
      external site that creates browser-based controls for processing 3, to make Minesweeper. Minesweeper is a
      videogame first designed in 1989 and came
      preinstalled with earlier versions of Windows.
    </p>
    <h2>What is Minesweeper</h2>
    <p><a></a>Minesweeper is a puzzle game with the objective of clearing a rectangular board containing hidden "mines"
      or
      bombs without detonating any of them. Each tile that is not a mine will have the number of mines surrounding it,
      and
      you must use those clues to uncover mines and other unmined tiles. You can win the game by openning all the
      unmined tiles.
    </p>
    <h2>Bugs...Ew!</h2>
    <p>
      As of this moment, most gamebreaking bugs have been fixed. If you do find any remaining bugs, please email either
      <a href="mailto: vwang30@stuy.edu">Vincent Wang</a> or <a href="mailto: tzhang30@stuy.edu">Thomas Zhang</a>.
