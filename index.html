      About this Program
    </h1>
    <h2>What does this Program do?</h2>
    <p> <a></a> This program uses <strong><a href="https://processing.org/">Processing 3</a></strong> and <strong><a
          href="http://www.micromind.com/processing/brc/BRCWebService.html">BRC</a></strong>, an
      external site that creates browser-based controls for processing 3, to make Minesweeper. Minesweeper is a
      videogame first designed in 1989 and came
      preinstalled with earlier versions of Windows. Google has a Minesweeper game that is still playable.

    </p>
    <h2>What is Minesweeper</h2>
    <p><a></a>Minesweeper is a puzzle game with the objective of clearing a rectangular tiles grid containing hidden "mines"
      or
      bombs without detonating any of them. Each tile that is not a mine will have the number of mines surrounding it,
      and
      you must use those clues to uncover tiles without mines. You can win the game by openning all the
      tiles without mines. You can flag tiles that you think are mines, but it is not necessary to use flags to win the game.
      In this version of Minesweeper, you will be playing against yourself, trying to get the best time possible for different
      difficulties. These times are saved and restored everytime you play. 
    </p>
    <h2>The Controls</h2>
    <p><a></a>At the start of your program, you should always click the "send all" button at the top of the BRC webpage. Sometimes, 
    you may run into a bug where even though your values are set to a given value, BRC will still send the default values of the sliders and buttons.
    If this is still a problem, you can try to reload the webpage.</p>
    <p><a></a>To reveal a tile, you have to Left Click the tile. To flag a tile, you have to Right Click the tile.</p>
    <p><a></a>To change the number of miles or tiles, use the sliders in the browser. You can also use the prebuilt
      difficulties. You must click the restart button once you change these controls to activate the changes</p>
    <p><a></a>Also in the BRC website, you will find a stopwatch and a list of Personal Best times for each difficulty.
      When you win a game, your best time will be saved. Remember, faster is better. </p>
      <p><a></a>This version of Minesweeper uses pictures for the tiles, bombs, and flags. Sometimes, this can be very exhausting on your computer,
      especially at the start of the program. If you find processing crashing sometimes, We recommend you activate the lower graphics button found on the BRC controls.
      Otherwise, we give you the ability to customize the mines. We know that some may not like the boring mine that comes default in the game, so we give you two new
      types of mines: bombs and smiley faces. If you instead want the added effect of your entire screen exploding when you click a mine, we recommend you use the mine
      type Bomb. If you want to see delightful smiley faces everytime you die, you'd be glad to hear we also have a smiley face mine type.</p>
