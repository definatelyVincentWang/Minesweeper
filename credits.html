        <p>This game was made by <strong>Vincent Wang and Thomas Zhang</strong>. Vincent Wang made the Tile class, the
          reveal() function, and the checkNewRecord() function, while Thomas Zhang made the checkBombs() function, the
          setup() function, and the draw() function.
          Both contributed to the creation of this website.

          Special thanks to our beta testers: <strong>Kevin Huang and Kelvin Zhao</strong> for finding many gamebreaking bugs
          and making other suggestions to help us bring you this game.
